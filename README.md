# Agenta Chat React App
A repo for a react test I was asked to complete by Ajenta.
To run the chat app either download the zip file or clone this repo to a folder on your machine.
When you have done that simply navigate to the folder with the chat app in your terminal and simply type npm start.
Of course as this a React app you need to have NPM installed on ypur machine to be able to run the site on your localhost.
